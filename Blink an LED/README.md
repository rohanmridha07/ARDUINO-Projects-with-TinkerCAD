### üí° Arduino Uno LED Blink

A foundational "Hello, world!" project for physical computing. This program demonstrates how to control a Light Emitting Diode (LED) by blinking it on and off using an Arduino Uno.

### üõ†Ô∏è Required Components

*   1 x Arduino Uno
*   1 x LED (any color)
*   1 x 1kŒ© Resistor
*   Jumper Wires
*   Breadboard (optional, but recommended for a clean setup)

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

#### üîå Circuit Setup

The circuit is designed to safely power an LED using a digital output pin on the Arduino. A resistor is crucial for limiting the current that flows through the LED, protecting it from burning out.

1.  Connect the **Anode** (long leg) of the LED to one end of the 1kŒ© resistor.
2.  Connect the other end of the resistor to **Digital Pin 13** on the Arduino Uno.
3.  Connect the **Cathode** (short leg) of the LED to the **GND** (Ground) pin on the Arduino.

#### üíª Program Logic

The code uses two main functions: `setup()` and `loop()`. The `setup()` function runs once to configure pin 13 as an output. The `loop()` function then runs continuously, repeatedly turning the LED on (`HIGH`), pausing for 500ms, turning it off (`LOW`), and pausing again. This sequence creates the steady blinking effect.

```
// C++ code
// Assign the LED to digital pin 13
int LED = 13;
void setup()
{
// Configure the pin as an output
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}
void loop()
{
// Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
// Wait for 500 milliseconds
delay(500);
// Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
// Wait for 500 milliseconds
delay(500);
}
```
### ‚ú® Applications
* Visual Indicators: Used as a status light to indicate power, a completed task, or an error state.
* Debugging Tool: Programmers often blink an LED to visually confirm that a specific section of code is being executed.
* Learning Foundation: Teaches the fundamental concepts of digital output, program loops, and basic circuit design.
* Simple Signaling: Can be adapted to create signals, like a Morse code transmitter or a simple warning light.
